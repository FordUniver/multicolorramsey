description: >
  Provides an equivalence between {n : ℕ // Even n} and ℕ via n ↦ n/2,
  and uses this to transform infinite sums over even indices into sums
  over all naturals: ∑' x, f (2*x) = ∑' x : {n | Even n}, f x

notes: >
  Simple but useful for working with series indexed by even numbers.
  Completely proven, very general (works for any AddCommMonoid with topology).
  Could alternatively go in Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Equiv.
