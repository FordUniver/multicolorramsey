target_file: Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Order
description: >
  Product inequality lemma for CommMonoidWithZero: if all elements in a finset
  are at least 1, then their product is at least 1. Fills a gap in Mathlib which
  has a version for IsOrderedMonoid but not for types with zero like ℝ.

notes: >
  Mathlib has Finset.one_le_prod' for ordered monoids, but this version works
  for types like ℝ which have zero but aren't ordered monoids. Used in
  coshsqrt calculations.
