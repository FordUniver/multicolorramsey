description: >
  Provides lemmas that find an element whose value bounds a sum or expectation.
  For any sum over a fintype or finset, there exists an element such that the
  entire sum is bounded by the cardinality times that element's value.
  Also proves existence of an element at least as large as the expectation.

  Cohesive set of lemmas for averaging/probabilistic arguments. All complete
  with straightforward proofs. Could alternatively go in Mathlib.Data.Fintype.Card
  or Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic depending on reviewer preference.
