\begin{theorem}[Balister et al. 2024] \label{thm:Ramsey:multicolour}
    For each $r \ge 2$, there exists $\delta = \delta(r) > 0$ such that 
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        R_r(k) \le e^{-\delta k} r^{rk}
    \end{equation*} 
    %
    for all sufficiently large $k \in \N$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We will prove the theorem for $r = 2$.
\end{proof}
