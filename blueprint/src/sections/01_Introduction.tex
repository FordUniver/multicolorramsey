This blueprint formalizes the proof from \cite{CGMS} of an exponential improvement to the classical Erdős-Szekeres upper bound for multicolor Ramsey numbers.

The $r$-color Ramsey number $R_r(k)$ is the minimum $n$ such that every $r$-coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ contains a monochromatic clique $K_k$.
Ramsey~\cite{Ramsey30} proved in 1930 that these numbers are finite, and Erdős and Szekeres~\cite{ESz35} showed in 1935 that $R_r(k) \le r^{rk}$.
For over 85 years, no improvement was known for the case $r \ge 3$.

The main result of this formalization establishes the first exponential improvement over the Erdős-Szekeres bound for all $r \ge 2$:

% MAIN THEOREM
% ============================================================================

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:Ramsey:multicolour}
    %
    For each $r \ge 2$, there exists $\delta = \delta(r) > 0$ such that
    %
    \begin{equation*}
        R_r(k) \le e^{-\delta k} r^{rk}
    \end{equation*}
    %
    for all sufficiently large $k \in \N$.
\end{theorem}

The proof introduces a new ``select and boost'' algorithm that iteratively finds large monochromatic substructures using a geometric lemma based on moment inequalities.
